# musicplayer

Simple music player app inspired by nashallery and the Barble The Island Princess CD player I used to have as a kid. Built using Javascript and HTML/CSS in Electron.

Currently features bops from the Ponyo album. Audio files are not included the repository for copyright reasons, but should be uploaded to assets/audios. May expand artwork into other Ghibli albums and/or Barbie movie soundtracks and add an album selector and other features in the future.



To run this music player, after cloning for the first time, run the following command
```shell
npm install electron --save-dev
```

Then, to launch the app, run
```shell
npm start
```
